0,What is the path integral formulation in QFT?,Computes amplitudes by summing over all field configurations weighted by exp(iS/ħ); equivalent to the operator formalism.
1,What is the renormalization group in QFT?,Describes how couplings run with energy scale via beta functions by systematically integrating out short‑distance modes.
2,What is gauge symmetry in QFT?,A local redundancy of the field description; enforcing it introduces gauge fields and dictates the interaction structure.
3,What is spontaneous symmetry breaking in QFT?,"The ground state fails to respect a symmetry of the laws, yielding Goldstone bosons (or masses via the Higgs mechanism)."
4,What is the Feynman propagator in QFT?,The time‑ordered Green’s function giving the amplitude to travel between points; the inverse of (□+m²) with causal boundary conditions.
5,What is a sufficient statistic?,A function of the data that retains all information about a parameter for a given model—no loss for inference.
6,What is the central limit theorem?,"The mean/sum of many independent, finite‑variance variables is approximately normal."
7,What is the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)?,The parameter value that maximizes the likelihood of the observed data under the model.
8,What is a confidence interval?,"A procedure that covers the true parameter with a stated long‑run frequency (e.g., 95%); not a posterior probability."
9,What is a p-value?,"The probability, assuming the null is true, of observing results at least as extreme as those seen."
10,What is VC dimension?,A capacity measure: the largest number of points a hypothesis class can shatter.
11,What is empirical risk minimization (ERM)?,Choose the model minimizing average loss on the training data.
12,What is structural risk minimization (SRM)?,Minimize a bound on risk by trading off fit and model complexity across nested classes (regularization).
13,What is the kernel trick?,Compute inner products via a kernel to act as if in high‑dimensional feature space without explicit mapping.
14,What is the bias–variance tradeoff?,Reducing bias often increases variance; best generalization balances the two to minimize expected error.
15,What is hermeneutics?,"The theory and methodology of interpretation, especially of texts."
16,What is semiotics?,"The study of signs, symbols, and how meaning is created."
17,What is historiography?,"The study of how history is written and the methods, sources, and interpretations historians use."
18,What is deconstruction?,A critical approach that exposes internal tensions in texts and shows meanings as contingent and unstable.
19,What is cultural relativism?,The view that beliefs and practices should be understood within their cultural context rather than judged externally.
20,How to delete Facebook account?,Settings → Accounts Center → Personal details → Account ownership & control → Deactivation or deletion → Delete account → confirm.
21,How to delete Instagram account?,Settings → Accounts Center → Personal details → Account ownership & control → Deactivation or deletion → Delete account → confirm.
22,How to screenshot on Mac?,"Shift+⌘+3 (full), Shift+⌘+4 (area), Shift+⌘+5 (options/record)."
23,How to screenshot on Windows?,"Win+Shift+S (Snipping Tool), PrtScn (copy screen), Win+PrtScn (save to Pictures/Screenshots)."
24,How to tie a tie?,"For a four‑in‑hand: cross wide over narrow, up through loop, around front, up through front loop, pull down and center."
25,How long to boil eggs?,"After boiling starts: soft 6–7 min, medium 8–9, hard 10–12; then ice bath."
26,How to calculate percentage?,"Percentage = (part/whole) × 100; e.g., 25 of 200 → 12.5%."
27,How to lose weight fast?,"Safest is gradual: 0.5–1% body weight/week via calorie deficit, high protein, resistance training, sleep; avoid crash diets."
28,How to lower blood pressure?,"DASH‑style eating, less sodium (~1.5–2 g/day), regular exercise, limit alcohol, healthy weight, stress control; follow clinician advice."
29,How to make money online?,"Sell skills (freelance), products (e‑commerce), or content; validate demand and avoid “get‑rich‑quick” schemes."
