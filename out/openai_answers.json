  {
    "question": "What is the central limit theorem?",
    "openai_answer": "The central limit theorem states that the sum or average of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables tends to follow a normal distribution, regardless of the original variable's distribution."

  {
    "question": "What is a confidence interval?",
    "openai_answer": "A confidence interval is a range of values, derived from sample data, that likely contains the true population parameter with a specified level of confidence, such as 95%."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a p-value?",
    "openai_answer": "A p-value measures the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true, helping assess the evidence against the null hypothesis in statistical tests."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is VC dimension?",
    "openai_answer": "VC dimension measures a model's capacity by the largest set of points it can classify correctly in all possible ways, indicating its ability to fit diverse data patterns."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is empirical risk minimization (ERM)?",
    "openai_answer": "Empirical risk minimization (ERM) is a machine learning approach that selects a model by minimizing the average loss on a given training dataset, aiming to reduce prediction errors on observed data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is structural risk minimization (SRM)?",
    "openai_answer": "Structural risk minimization is a machine learning principle that balances model complexity and training error to minimize the overall risk of poor generalization on new data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the kernel trick?",
    "openai_answer": "The kernel trick is a method in machine learning that allows algorithms to operate in high-dimensional spaces without explicitly computing coordinates, enabling efficient nonlinear classification and regression."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the bias–variance tradeoff?",
    "openai_answer": "The bias–variance tradeoff is the balance between a model's simplicity (bias) and its sensitivity to data fluctuations (variance), affecting its accuracy and ability to generalize to new data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is hermeneutics?",
    "openai_answer": "Hermeneutics is the study and theory of interpretation, especially of texts, language, and symbolic expressions, focusing on understanding meaning in context."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is semiotics?",
    "openai_answer": "Semiotics is the study of signs and symbols and how they create meaning in communication and culture."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is historiography?",
    "openai_answer": "Historiography is the study of how history is written, including the methods, sources, interpretations, and biases historians use to understand and present past events."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is deconstruction?",
    "openai_answer": "Deconstruction is a critical approach that analyzes texts to reveal hidden meanings, contradictions, and assumptions, showing how language shapes understanding and challenges fixed interpretations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is cultural relativism?",
    "openai_answer": "Cultural relativism is the idea that a person's beliefs and practices should be understood based on their own culture, not judged by the standards of another culture."

    "openai_answer": "Go to Facebook settings, select \"Your Facebook Information,\" then \"Deactivation and Deletion,\" choose \"Delete Account,\" follow prompts, and confirm to permanently delete your Facebook account."
  },
  {
    "question": "How to delete Instagram account?",
    "openai_answer": "To delete your Instagram account, go to the Delete Your Account page on Instagram's website, log in, select a reason, re-enter your password, and click \"Permanently delete my account.\" This cannot be undone."

  {
    "question": "How to calculate percentage?",
    "openai_answer": "To calculate a percentage, divide the part by the whole, then multiply the result by 100. For example, (part ÷ whole) × 100 = percentage."
